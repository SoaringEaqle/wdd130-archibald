            <p>To get started, you are going to need a couple of things. There are only a few things that are actually required, which include Legos, a camera, and editing software. I want to touch on the most important materials to use when first starting out and give some tips on how to use them.</p>
            <div id = "tripod">
                <h2>Tripod:</h2>
                <p>Some beginner stop-motion animators just prop up their phones against some Legos to film, but in order to minimize the shaking in the video as much as possible, a tripod is recommended. Luckily, there are some cheap tripod options to choose from. It’s important to choose a flexible leg tripod so you can keep it on the table and get the angles you want.</p>

            <div id = "putty">
                <h3>Putty:</h3>
                <p>You need to find a way to keep your sets still while you film, so using putty is recommended. This can also help with positioning the mini-figures exactly where you want them without them falling over.</p>

            <div id = "editing">
                <h4>Editing Software:</h4>
                <p>There are plenty of stop-motion apps you can use to put all your photos together, and you should look for one that works for you. I use Stop Motion Studio, which is free and works well. You can also use multiple editing software to handle different effects you want in your movie, like adding sound.</p>
